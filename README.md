## Openwallet Services

### Transfers

We couldn't call Openwallet a financial app without offering the essential service of every bank: **money transfers**. 

But we went further: we designed a **smooth, user-friendly experience** that lets you send money to your contacts with just a few taps. Thanks to Open Payments integration, transfers are **instant and secure**, with no complications.

### QR Code

Openwallet makes in-person and remote payments easy with **dynamic QR codes**. Users can:

- **Generate their own QR code** to receive payments
- **Scan someone else's code** to send money instantly

Perfect for small businesses, events, or quick exchanges—no need to type account details.

### Donations

Openwallet doesn't just improve users' lives—it aims to **make a difference for others**. 

Within the app, users can easily donate to projects, foundations, or social causes, choosing who to support and how much to give, **starting from as little as 1 peso**.

We believe in a more human digital economy—where helping is as easy as sending a message.

### Scheduled Payments

One of Openwallet's most useful features is **payment automation**. 

You can **schedule future or recurring payments** (for example, rent, bills, or subscriptions) and never worry about forgetting again. The system notifies you before executing each payment and ensures funds are released correctly, offering **peace of mind and full control** over your finances.

### Support for Streamers

Openwallet also empowers **content creators**. 

Users can **instantly donate to streamers**, directly through the app, without intermediaries or high fees. Streamers can generate their **personal QR code or payment link**, receive real-time contributions, and manage their income transparently.
